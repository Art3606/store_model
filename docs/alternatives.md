## Alternatives

- [store_attribute](https://github.com/palkan/store_attribute)–work with JSON fields as an attributes, defined on the ActiveRecord model (not in the separate class)
- [jsonb_accessor](https://github.com/devmynd/jsonb_accessor)–same thing, but with built-in queries
- [attr_json](https://github.com/jrochkind/attr_json)–works like previous one, but using `ActiveModel::Type`
